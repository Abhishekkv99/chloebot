Most AI research today is done by universities and large corporate AI labs. Our goal is to make pursuit of science and creativity a viable project for any mind that loves the feeling of awe, from all walks of life, not just the academic elite. 

The goal here is to make new research approachable, silly and fun to the average developer or  interested motivated enthusiast with some basic understanding of linear algebra and programming. We will be building a chatbot and updating it's abilities using the latest research in AI and our own ideas. [Python tutorials](https://www.learnpython.org/) are everywhere on the internet. If you want to learn python so you can learn how Deep Learning Transformers work for Natural Language Processing i suggest learning through [ipython](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) or [jupyter notebooks](https://youtu.be/pxPzuyCOoMI) like this one. For a visual intro to linear algebra i reccomend [Essence of linear algebra](https://youtu.be/fNk_zzaMoSs) and how it applies to neural networks [Deep learning](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk) by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)

Chloebot is a continually evolving conversational neural network based on the Transformer sequence model. Modules are thoroughly explained and demonstrated using jupyter ipython notebooks. You can use chloebots components to build your own intelligent agents and programs,but learn how they work first by seeing how they are used to make Chloebot smarter in simple toy example that build up from basic linear algebra and programming concepts. 



install  [virtual environment](https://towardsdatascience.com/virtual-environments-104c62d48c54) then create a python 3.6 virtual environment

`$ python3 -m venv env`

Whenever you want to modify the code, activate virtual environment with python 3.6 inside the same folder as your environment env using 

`$ source env/bin/activate`

install dependencies

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

save new dependences to requirements

`$ pip freeze > requirements.txt`

You can deactivate the virtual environment using the following command in your terminal:

`$ deactivate`
