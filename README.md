Most AI research today is done by universities and large corporate AI labs. Our goal is to make the pursuit of this type of science and creativity a viable project for any mind that is excited by that feeling of mystery and building working machines, from all walks of life, not just the academic elite

The goal here is to make new research approachable, silly and fun to the beginner programmer or motivated amateur with some basic understanding of linear algebra and computer science. We will be building a chatbot and updating it's abilities using the latest research and our own ideas. Chloebot is a conversational neural network based on the Transformer sequence model. Modules are thoroughly explained and demonstrated using jupyter notebooks and toy examples that build from basic linear algebra and programming.

[Python tutorials](https://www.learnpython.org/) are everywhere on the internet. If you want to learn python so you can learn how Deep Learning Transformers work for Natural Language Processing i suggest learning through  [jupyter notebooks](https://youtu.be/pxPzuyCOoMI) like [this one](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/). For a visual intro to linear algebra i recommend [Essence of linear algebra](https://youtu.be/fNk_zzaMoSs) and how it applies to neural networks [Deep learning](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk) by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)

### How to Start

I am serious when I say "build advanced concepts from the very basics",so bare with me. 

install [virtual environment](https://towardsdatascience.com/virtual-environments-104c62d48c54) then create a python 3.6 virtual environment

`$ python3 -m venv env`

Whenever you want to modify the code, activate virtual environment with python 3.6 inside the same folder as your environment env using 

`$ source env/bin/activate`

install dependencies

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

save new dependences to requirements

`$ pip freeze > requirements.txt`

You can deactivate the virtual environment using the following command in your terminal:

`$ deactivate`
