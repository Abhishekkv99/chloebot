To do this nltk will need to download a folder called corpora, right now it is pointing to the *saved* folder, to change this, replace `./saved/` with your prefered path. Run the cells from top to bottom."

    "Neural network optimization is a whole field in itself, we will talk more about this in the future. The learning rate `opt.lr` is a hyperparameter whose initial value we choose, it modified the magnitude that the Adam optimizer algorithm will update the weights, aka parameters, of the neural network model during training. As training progresses the learning rate is also changing according to a scheduler [cosine annealing schedule](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/issues/1642). `epochs` is the number of times we will cycle through the data during training. If you trained on the same dataset in a different sitting and would like to reload that trained model instead of training from scratch, simply paste this line of code below `model.load_state_dict(torch.load(opt.save_path))`"
